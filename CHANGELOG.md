## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.2] - 2026-09-07

### Fixed

- Bound filament-switch AMS units to both extruders in the Studio plugin's telemetry projection: the synthesized AMS-unit `info` now encodes Studio's `0xE` both-extruders binding from the Agent's normalized `toolhead: "LR"` whenever the filament-switch flag is set, raw routing hex still passes through verbatim when present and usable, and units without the flag keep the legacy main-extruder projection because Studio rejects `0xE` without its own switch state — the reported X2D left-nozzle AMS mismatch.
- Kept the canonical tenant profile through the Studio native `change_user` login handoff: a matching token and user id now confirm the login the Hub ticket exchange already committed without applying a mutation, a mismatched token or identity is rejected with `stale_account_response` instead of overwriting the session, and persisted authenticated sessions written without tenant context by the old envelope path are retired at startup so Studio falls back to the normal Pandar sign-in flow instead of appearing logged in with a printer cache that cannot initialize.

### Removed

- Removed stale dead-code suppressions from the Hub (four `#[cfg_attr(not(test), allow(dead_code))]` markers guarding production-reachable helpers and the never-read `JwtClaims.nbf` field), the caller-free `StudioAbiSeries::reference_version_components` accessor, and the dead `inventory.switchNozzle` dashboard message key.

### Distribution

- The release publishes seven ABI-series-specific CLI, network plugin, and BambuSource archive sets with SHA-256 sidecars; Windows also publishes Studio hook bundles.
- Hub and Web images are published at `ghcr.io/projectpandar/pandar/hub:v0.2.2` and `ghcr.io/projectpandar/pandar/web:v0.2.2`.
- Helm chart `0.2.2` is published at `oci://ghcr.io/projectpandar/pandar/chart/pandar`.

### Known limitations

- Desktop archives remain unsigned. Verify the supplied SHA-256 sidecar; Windows SmartScreen and macOS Gatekeeper may warn.
- Real-host installation and real Bambu Studio replacement evidence is not complete for every target and ABI series.
- The container images target Linux amd64 only.
- Native firmware and recovery ownership still requires one active Hub; the firmware package catalog is intentionally empty.
- The Android client is built separately and is not attached to the GitHub Release.


## [0.2.1] - 2026-09-03

### Changed

- Centralized the release version in `Cargo.toml` `[workspace.package]` and a single `nix/pandar.nix` literal; workspace members inherit `version.workspace = true` and `scripts/check-release-version.sh` enforces the single source of truth.

### Removed

- Removed the test-only bulk `retryDispatchJobs`/`duplicateJob` server actions with their orphaned `retry_partial`/`duplicate_queued` statuses and translations; the single-job retry action and Hub recovery endpoints are unchanged.
- Removed orphaned UI and script leaves: the unused dashboard `Separator` primitive, the unused Android `MonoText` composable, and the nested frontend `build:plugin-local` script.
- Removed the one-shot bundle-size measurement script with its stale baseline, the superseded Phase 21 ABI symbol listing plus its vestigial Nix source filter, and the completed implementation-tracking plans; durable contracts remain with the specs, architecture, compatibility, and changelog owners.

### Fixed

- Restored the manually selected Pandar server before Studio login evaluation: a Web URL chosen on the plugin's local sign-in page and its discovered canonical Hub identity now persist (`pandar-plugin-server-selection.json`, typed, durable replacement) and are restored on the next clean launch without URL environment variables, so a valid same-Hub login is visible through the Studio ABI without another sign-in. Explicit `PANDAR_PLUGIN_*`/`APP_*` URL configuration stays authoritative, a credential belonging to a different Hub is never restored, and a malformed selection fails closed with its diagnostic logged.

### Distribution

- The release publishes seven ABI-series-specific CLI, network plugin, and BambuSource archive sets with SHA-256 sidecars; Windows also publishes Studio hook bundles.
- Hub and Web images are published at `ghcr.io/projectpandar/pandar/hub:v0.2.1` and `ghcr.io/projectpandar/pandar/web:v0.2.1`.
- Helm chart `0.2.1` is published at `oci://ghcr.io/projectpandar/pandar/chart/pandar`.

### Known limitations

- Desktop archives remain unsigned. Verify the supplied SHA-256 sidecar; Windows SmartScreen and macOS Gatekeeper may warn.
- Real-host installation and real Bambu Studio replacement evidence is not complete for every target and ABI series.
- The container images target Linux amd64 only.
- Native firmware and recovery ownership still requires one active Hub; the firmware package catalog is intentionally empty.
- The Android client is built separately and is not attached to the GitHub Release.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-31

### Added

- Added ABI-series-specific support for Bambu Studio `02.08.02.61`, including its appended `PrintParams::queue_plate_id` layout and `bambu_network_sync_slot_mappings` export. Slot-mapping cloud synchronization remains an explicit unsupported operation; target-native package validation passed, while real-Studio validation remains separate and is not claimed.
- Added authenticated Bambu Studio personal-preset synchronization and a versioned live printer-event stream with generation-fenced caching and recovery.
- Added one generated OpenAPI Hub-client contract for Web and Android, canonical printer capability projections, and shared printer-operation and Agent wire models.
- Added a durable artifact reservation, deletion, retry, and cleanup lifecycle with equivalent SQLite and PostgreSQL behavior.

### Changed

- Consolidated network-plugin runtime, freshness, account, firmware, and dispatch ownership behind Rust `PluginCore` operations while keeping the C++ layer limited to ABI, STL, callback, and thread adaptation.
- Made Agent command transitions, Hub printer snapshots, cleanup planning, print execution input, and artifact persistence atomic around their owning domain boundaries.
- Reworked Android around one reactive authenticated Hub session and one generation-fenced domain state owner; Web routes now use focused views and resource-owned query state.
- Replaced resource-specific job-storage compatibility facades with the backend-neutral `ArtifactStorage` boundary and one opaque storage key.

### Fixed

- Fixed protected FTPS uploads on affected printers by reusing the control-channel TLS session for protected data connections while preserving complete causal errors.
- Fixed BambuSource reader-thread self-close, file-transfer callback replacement races, recursive callback dispatch, and result-handle lifetime during foreign callbacks.
- Fixed cross-replica command-result delivery, tenant-scoped event invalidation, concurrent last-admin demotion, stale Agent session transitions, and MQTT overflow recovery.
- Fixed required-nullable Android wire presence, dashboard membership fail-closed behavior, redirected action feedback, repeated secret redaction, and healthy WebSocket reconnect backoff.

### Security

- Removed production artifact-path and compatibility fallbacks, retired plugin FFI surfaces, and duplicate low-level storage APIs.
- Marked every pointer-validity-dependent Rust/C export unsafe with explicit ownership, callback, nested-view, and lifetime contracts.
- Made release-version invariants, Android tests and lint, Nix auth smoke tests, pinned Studio contracts, module-size checks, and dual-backend parity durable CI gates.

### Distribution

- The release publishes seven ABI-series-specific CLI, network plugin, and BambuSource archive sets with SHA-256 sidecars; Windows also publishes Studio hook bundles.
- Hub and Web images are published at `ghcr.io/projectpandar/pandar/hub:v0.2.0` and `ghcr.io/projectpandar/pandar/web:v0.2.0`.
- Helm chart `0.2.0` is published at `oci://ghcr.io/projectpandar/pandar/chart/pandar`.

### Known limitations

## [0.1.4] - 2026-08-11

### Fixed

### Distribution

- The release publishes ABI-series-specific CLI, network plugin, and BambuSource archives with SHA-256 sidecars; Windows also publishes Studio hook bundles.
- Hub and Web images are published at `ghcr.io/projectpandar/pandar/hub:v0.1.4` and `ghcr.io/projectpandar/pandar/web:v0.1.4`.
- Helm chart `0.1.4` is published at `oci://ghcr.io/projectpandar/pandar/chart/pandar`.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-08-11

### Fixed

- Moved the Studio sign-in external-auth probe from the private observability-only `/readyz` route to the public, sanitized `/api/v1/auth/status` endpoint, eliminating the `Readiness check returned 404` failure on normal Hub deployments.

### Distribution

## [0.1.2] - 2026-08-10

### Changed

- Simplified Bambu Studio plugin targeting to a single Web URL and added Web-hosted Hub URL discovery through `/.well-known/pandar`.
- Added `APP_PUBLIC_API_URL` for deployments whose Studio-reachable Hub URL differs from the Web server's internal `APP_API_URL`.

### Fixed

- Changed the Studio sign-in external-auth probe from `/healthz` to `/readyz`; a post-release follow-up was required because `/readyz` is available only on the private observability listener.

- Added fail-closed H2C nozzle-rack telemetry and controls, mixed AMS Lite routing, AMS filament drying controls, and broader printer motion support.
- Added secure Studio local-camera streaming plus persistent browser picture-in-picture playback.
- Added live cooling-system telemetry and fan controls, current print-speed display and switching, and catalog-backed HMS messages in printer details.
- Added richer Agents, settings, printer-link, printer-control, and attention workflows in the Web dashboard.

### Changed

- Moved Studio status projection, File Transfer ABI behavior, and connection-delivery policy behind typed Rust interfaces while keeping the C++ shim ABI-only.
- Centralized Web printer-control contracts and unified interactive surfaces on the shared Button component.
- Moved the repository and published artifact paths to the ProjectPandar organization.

### Fixed

- Required protected FTPS data channels, verified Bambu v1 MQTT certificates, and added bounded direct-host printer discovery when multicast is unavailable.
- Corrected full-status authority, H2C sequencing, A2L usage routing, printer-model projection, and several printer-control and responsive-layout issues.
- Preserved actionable printer-link errors and camera picture-in-picture sessions across dashboard navigation.

### Security
